# PyClustree

Single cell clustering at a glance. 
Identify which clustering resolution(s) fit your data within minutes.

PyClustree offers:
  - Automated clustering (leiden/louvain) at various resolutions
  - Automatic selection of significant resolutions
  - Visualization of clusters per resolution and their relative compositions 
  - Easy to use, yet highly customizable Python API
  - Cluster recoloring for PyClustree and UMAP visualization (see below)

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siebrenf/pyclustree.git
pip install pyclustree
```

## Dev install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siebrenf/pyclustree.git
conda env create -n pyclustree -f pyclustree/requirements.yaml
conda activate pyclustree
pip install --editable ./pyclustree --no-deps --ignore-installed
```

The UMAPs and cluster tree can be compared immediately due to the automatic renaming and recoloring of the clusters. 
Without renaming and recoloring, figures would have looked like this:

For example, note how cluster 2 becomes cluster 3 at resolution 0.53.
